cdpr - Cisco Discovery Protocol Reporter
Copyright (c) 2002 MonkeyMental.com

Version 1.0.4

I originally wrote this program to report which switch, and port a machine
is connected to. In a large environment sometimes it is difficult to determine
which port on which switch a machine is connected to.

By default (with no command line options) cdpr will determine a network interface
to open, put into promiscuous mode and wait for a single CDP packet to be received.

On multi-homed machines, you can specify which interface to use with the -d option.

Example (to determine which switch/port eth1 is connected to):
	cdpr -d eth1

You can dump the whole cdp packet using -v (more v's = more output).

Sample Output:
cdpr - Cisco Discovery Protocol Reporter Version 1.0.0
Copyright (c) 2002 - MonkeyMental.com

Using Device: eth0
Waiting for CDP advertisement, default config is to transmit CDP packets every 60 seconds
Device ID
  value:  mtview-3548-access-1.i2.com
Addresses
  value:  10.100.230.14
Port ID
  value:  FastEthernet0/4

As you can see above, by default CDP packets are broadcast every 60 seconds, cdpr will wait
until a CDP packet is received. 

I hope you find this utility useful. Thanks to Manfred Siemsen for helping to decode the 
packet data.
